Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download here
npm: Comes with Node.js
Vercel CLI (optional for deployment): Get it here
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the WebSocket server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Start both the frontend and backend servers:

Run the WebSocket server:
bash
Copy code
cd websocket-server
npm start
Run the React app:
bash
Copy code
cd websocket-client
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Observe real-time updates in the UI as the WebSocket server sends messages.

Deployment
Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
Install the Vercel CLI:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g vercel
Deploy the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd client
vercel
Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

Backend Deployment (Render)
Push the server folder to a GitHub repository.

Go to Render and create a new Web Service.

Point Render to your GitHub repository, specifying the server folder.

Set the start command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Deploy and note the WebSocket server URL.

Update the WebSocket URL in your React app (WEBSOCKET_URL in App.js).
